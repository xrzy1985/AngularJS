  - built upon JavaScript and jQuery
  - dynamically update webpage as data changes
  - MVC
    - using the MVC to structure your code will make the site
        easier to maintain, easier to update, and ensure the code
        is much more readable

  Model

    - generally a database
    - MSSQL, Azure, Firebase

    - jQuery
    - API

        - webpages will be modified using the DOM object

      Directives
